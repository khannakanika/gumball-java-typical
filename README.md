assignment-1-gumball-khannakanika created by GitHub Classroom In this assignment, I have made an interface where the user is asked to choose which Gumball machine does he want to use. After he/she has done that, they are asked to input the quarters. These machines are intelligent enough and even dispense more than one gumball depending upon the number of quarters that the user has put in the machine. These machines let the user insert all the money that he wants to input, eject the gumball, but do not give back the change.
